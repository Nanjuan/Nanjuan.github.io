### **Converting ova and vmdk to qcow2** [Tutorial](./Hacking-Tutorials/How-to-convert-ova-and-vmdk-to-qcow2.md).

This tutorial will show you how to convert .ova and .vmdk to qcow2. While working with a client, I came alone this issue that we build an environment in VMware because they were going to deploy it in EXSI, but last minute they change to Antsle and AWS environment and when they imported the .ova or .vmdk they were having right only VMs which cause an issue. So I gather all the info I needed to convert these VMs before importing them to the Antsle boxes. I decided to create this tutorial to help others convert their .ova .vmdk to qcow2.
